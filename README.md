Demo project is using clean architecture principles and with MVI and single activity architecture. 
Fake data is created and used in NewsDataSourceImpl and once the API is ready the service factory code can be uncommented. 
Dute to less time I have not been able to add unit and UI test but I would have added them in case this was a production code. 
I have tried to build a decent UI but not. everything in wireframes is implemented. In designes I think in detail screen the paragraphs and images could have been shown in tab format and 
may be view pagers can be added as weel to improve the UI. 
I have created different module for API as segregates the code a bit and modules can be build parrelelly which improves the build time.
